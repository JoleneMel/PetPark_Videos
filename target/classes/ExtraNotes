Week 13 (plus my own thoughts added to it)
-Spring Boot is a Java development framework, that will make programming a lot easier by automating common repetitive processes. 

	-In week 12 we will learn about sring boot by developing REST APIS 
			-REST: A set of constraints to build compatible applications. 
			
			-API: A set of end points (URLS) that perform actions or return data 
			
			//NOTES ABOUT MAPPING IN GENERAL  :) 
			(Note mapping will be used to create the end points, starting with requestmapping, and then anything after that will be 
			after requestmapping. 
			
			Example if your RequestMapping("/pet_park") and your PostMapping("/pet_park") your Post URL will be not 
			http://localhost:8080/pet_park
			but 
			http://localhost:8080/pet_park/pet_park/
			
			BUT if your RequestMapping("/pet_park") and your PostMapping() your Post URL will be
			http://localhost:8080/pet_park
			
			With every additional POST, GET, PUT, OR DELETE MAPPING the endpoints have to not match (so no 2 post mapping can have the same end points)
			(or delete, get, puts, if you have more than 1 of them you will need to ensure the endpoint can be identifiable for the program to define 
			which are you referring to) 
			
	Material for the upcoming weeks~
		2 Rest APIS 
			1. (Current project) Pet Park Locations API, over weeks 13 and 14 (or week 1 and 2) 
				-1b. Assignment/homework is a Pet Sore API (weeks 1-3)
				
			2. Dog Rescur API over weeks 15 and week 16 (or week 3-4) 
			
	
	Weeks Content 
		-Each API will cover the following: 
			How to create a Spring Boot project 
			Use Spring JPA (Java Persistence API) to create tables and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
				
				HttpMapping and meanings within CRUD 
				Create = PostMapping
				Read = GetMapping
				Update = PutMapping
				Delete = DeleteMapping. 
				
			How to create one-to many and many-to-many relationships with JPA 
			
			How to work with Springs Dependency Injection Framework 
			
	Additional Content aka Breakout Videos 
		-Extra videos that go into depth on central Spring Boot topics 
		
			-Examples 
				-Spring vs. Spring Boot 
				-Spring JPA vs Spring JDBC
				-JPA Relationships 
				-Dependency Injection
				-etc.
